        "description": "<p>Rockstar Games went bigger, since their previous installment of the series. You get the complicated and realistic world-building from Liberty City of GTA4 in the setting of lively and diverse Los Santos, from an old fan favorite GTA San Andreas. 561 different vehicles (including every transport you can operate) and the amount is rising with every update. <br />\nSimultaneous storytelling from three unique perspectives: <br />\nFollow Michael, ex-criminal living his life of leisure away from the past, Franklin, a kid that seeks the better future, and Trevor, the exact past Michael is trying to run away from. <br />\nGTA Online will provide a lot of additional challenge even for the experienced players, coming fresh from the story mode. Now you will have other players around that can help you just as likely as ruin your mission. Every GTA mechanic up to date can be experienced by players through the unique customizable character, and community content paired with the leveling system tends to keep everyone busy and engaged.</p>\n<p>Español<br />\nRockstar Games se hizo más grande desde su entrega anterior de la serie.

        "description": "First contact didn't go as planned, when aliens woke Murray Mendelson up from his afternoon nap. Pulling the trigger first has drawn Murray in to full scale war with these alien visitors, and they’ll stop at nothing to destroy him. Armed with his musket and inconsolable rage, Murray must defend his home against all odds. Why are the aliens only attacking this one house? Who knows?! Shoot first and ask questions later in this endless fast paced arcade shooter, and keep those pesky aliens off of Murray's perfectly manicured lawn!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nCollect valuable alien orbs to upgrade your weaponry. Use ‘Cane Time’, ‘Infuriate’, and ‘Soundwave’ power-ups to gain the upper hand when all seems lost. The longer Murray holds the lawn, the stronger those aliens get. But there is plenty of firepower waiting for you to try out in The Shed.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nSo, lock and load…and Get Off My Lawn!",

Pulling the trigger first has drawn Murray in to full scale war with these alien visitors, and they’ll stop at nothing to destroy him. Armed with his musket and inconsolable rage, Murray must defend his home against all odds. Why are the aliens only attacking this one house? Who knows?! Shoot first and ask questions later in this endless fast paced arcade shooter, and keep those pesky aliens off of Murray's perfectly manicured lawn!\nCollect valuable alien orbs to upgrade your weaponry. Use ‘Cane Time’, ‘Infuriate’, and ‘Soundwave’ power-ups to gain the upper hand when all seems lost. The longer Murray holds the lawn, the stronger those aliens get. But there is plenty of firepower waiting for you to try out in The Shed.\nSo, lock and load…and Get Off My Lawn!"

        "description": "<p>&quot;Sony exclusives are mostly story driven experiences and Unfinished Swan is no exception. It’s a first-person adventure game about a young boy named Monroe, who recently lost his mother, famous artist known for not finishing a painting, adding up to the number of her incomplete works. And out of all her works, Monroe is permitted to keep only one favorite, a swan with a missing neck. And one night he wakes up to see the swan escape, and after the short chase players will find themselves in a painted unfinished world, finding the missing swan.<br />\nOver the course of the game, players will use a magic silver brush to spread the black paint over the blank and completely white environment, to locate a way to progress and solutions to puzzles, while the narrator tells a story of a Lonely King. Most of the environments and the painting tool are used to show players, that Unfinished Swan is more of a narrative experience, where puzzles are not stopping your progress entirely, but act as an obstacle. There is no active combat in the game, so the actions of the player will wholly dictate the pace and completion.</p>",

It’s a first-person adventure game about a young boy named Monroe, who recently lost his mother, famous artist known for not finishing a painting, adding up to the number of her incomplete works. And out of all her works, Monroe is permitted to keep only one favorite, a swan with a missing neck. And one night he wakes up to see the swan escape, and after the short chase players will find themselves in a painted unfinished world, finding the missing swan.\nOver the course of the game, players will use a magic silver brush to spread the black paint over the blank and completely white environment, to locate a way to progress and solutions to puzzles, while the narrator tells a story of a Lonely King. Most of the environments and the painting tool are used to show players, that Unfinished Swan is more of a narrative experience, where puzzles are not stopping your progress entirely, but act as an obstacle. There is no active combat in the game, so the actions of the player will wholly dictate the pace and completion."

The story tells about the formation of Hyperion Corporation and the fate of its head - Handsome Jack, whom we meet while in the role of a simple programmer who dreams to find some valuable artifact. In the game there are various innovations - in the plot, in the characters, in the scenarios of missions and in the setting. For example, on the Pandora satellite, gravity is much weaker, but there is no oxygen at all. Therefore, the task of obtaining oxygen becomes very important for everyone. Moreover, oxygen is needed not only for breathing, but also for the functioning of personal jetpacks and long high jumps. In the game there is another additional story and downloadable content, including new characters and story campaigns.</p>",

The story tells about the formation of Hyperion Corporation and the fate of its head - Handsome Jack, whom we meet while in the role of a simple programmer who dreams to find some valuable artifact. In the game there are various innovations - in the plot, in the characters, in the scenarios of missions and in the setting. For example, on the Pandora satellite, gravity is much weaker, but there is no oxygen at all. Therefore, the task of obtaining oxygen becomes very important for everyone. Moreover, oxygen is needed not only for breathing, but also for the functioning of personal jetpacks and long high jumps. In the game there is another additional story and downloadable content, including new characters and story campaigns."

The hope to find other survivors is fueled by the messages found by the hero, which say that somewhere these survivors still exist.</p>\n<p>Mirrors serve as portals for getting into the apartment of the survivor and back. This apartment is a place where you can stay safe and sleep - it will allow the hero to keep mental health, otherwise he runs the risk of going insane.<br />\nDuring sleep, the hero comes to dreams, and sometimes hallucinations. Their content depends on the type of sleeping pills that the hero takes. Hallucinations can visit the hero regardless of sleep and cheerfulness. Because of this, the same rooms can look quite differently during visits at different times. The hero (and the player), in general, quickly realize that with the adequacy of the perception of the hero something is very wrong.<br />\nA flashlight helps to move forward, and mutants make it difficult to advance. They can be killed, but you can pass unnoticed by them. To kill mutants, the hero uses weapons.</p>\n<p>Sometimes progress is impossible without a special things that must be found.<br />\nDepending on the choices and actions of the player, you can end the game with five different endings.</p>",

The hope to find other survivors is fueled by the messages found by the hero, which say that somewhere these survivors still exist.\n\nMirrors serve as portals for getting into the apartment of the survivor and back. This apartment is a place where you can stay safe and sleep - it will allow the hero to keep mental health, otherwise he runs the risk of going insane.\nDuring sleep, the hero comes to dreams, and sometimes hallucinations. Their content depends on the type of sleeping pills that the hero takes. Hallucinations can visit the hero regardless of sleep and cheerfulness. Because of this, the same rooms can look quite differently during visits at different times. The hero (and the player), in general, quickly realize that with the adequacy of the perception of the hero something is very wrong.\nA flashlight helps to move forward, and mutants make it difficult to advance. They can be killed, but you can pass unnoticed by them. To kill mutants, the hero uses weapons.\n\nSometimes progress is impossible without a special things that must be found.\nDepending on the choices and actions of the player, you can end the game with five different endings."

Players compete in fencing in the pixelated game world. Despite the simplicity of the concept and of the controls, the game is very competitive, and many media called the game one of the best multiplayer experience of 2014. The name is consonant with serpent from the Norse mythology Níðhöggr, the snake appears in the game, eating the winner of the duel. The game draws inspiration from the game, which was released in 1984 - Great Swordsman, and for development used software GameMaker: Studio, which is available on Steam. Who wouldn’t want to create a game where you impale a friend, eh? </p>\n<h3>Key features</h3>\n<p>Players get control over two game models that differ only in color. Controls are standard: jump, move, slide and throw the sword at your opponent. You can attack at three different heights: high, medium and low. Hit the opponent&#39;s sword to disarm the latter, and he will have to raise the sword again. The main task is to reach the end of the enemy territory. The first player who accomplished this wins. There are four different levels available for solo, local and online multiplayer. Later, the developers added new modes, like a tournament and the ability to use weapons differently.</p>",

Players compete in fencing in the pixelated game world. Despite the simplicity of the concept and of the controls, the game is very competitive, and many media called the game one of the best multiplayer experience of 2014. The name is consonant with serpent from the Norse mythology Níðhöggr, the snake appears in the game, eating the winner of the duel. The game draws inspiration from the game, which was released in 1984 - Great Swordsman, and for development used software GameMaker: Studio, which is available on Steam. Who wouldn’t want to create a game where you impale a friend, eh? \n\n###Key features\nPlayers get control over two game models that differ only in color. Controls are standard: jump, move, slide and throw the sword at your opponent. You can attack at three different heights: high, medium and low. Hit the opponent's sword to disarm the latter, and he will have to raise the sword again. The main task is to reach the end of the enemy territory. The first player who accomplished this wins. There are four different levels available for solo, local and online multiplayer. Later, the developers added new modes, like a tournament and the ability to use weapons differently."

        "description": "<p>From the Warring States period to the present day, the mysterious shinobi have fought covertly across Japan. Some fight for the authorities, others for the highest bidder, but all of them have one thing in common: They kick ass and know how to look good doing it.<br />\nSENRAN KAGURA SHINOVI VERSUS immediately follows the events of SENRAN KAGURA Burst, revisiting the fierce rivalry between the girls of Hanzō National Academy and their sworn enemies from Hebijo Clandestine Girls’ Academy, the latter of which have now gone underground and formed a mercenary strike team known as the Homura Crimson Squad. In addition to their old adversaries, the Hanzō girls must also face a whole new set of foes: the students of Gessen Girls’ Academy, who seek to punish them for their imperfections as shinobi warriors. Meanwhile, a new class is in session at Hebijo, and these students mean business: they oppose all three of the competing factions and will stop at nothing to be the last shinobi squad standing – even if it means leaving broken bodies and shattered dreams in their wake.<br />\nThe stage is set for a shinobi battle royale. Heroines and renegades battle saints and sinners in a flurry of fists, feet, clothes, tattered remnants of those clothes, and sometimes underclothes. Each school has a story to tell, full of tragedy, heroism, pathos and partial nudity. Choose a school, prepare for battle, and follow the Path of the Shinobi.Key Features:A Little Violent, a Little Sexy, a Ton of Fun<br />\nFight with a team of buxom ninja girls in a 3D brawler containing massive mid-air combos, revealing cut-scenes and special Secret Ninja Art techniques, all while struggling to stay clothed as damage is depicted by the deterioration of each girl’s outfit. Now in HD and silky smooth 60fps on Windows PC.<br />\nMaster over 20 Fighters, each with a Unique Fighting Style and Abilities<br />\nEach of the 20+ shinobi has her own unique weapon, techniques and special moves, while Ninja Arts can be harnessed to change costumes and power up in mid-battle. PC version comes standard with all DLC from the original PlayStation(r)Vita system release.<br />\nStory Narrative told from Four Different Viewpoints<br />\nEach of the four rival shinobi schools takes a turn at the story narrative, providing background on motivations, relationships and hobbies, while the original Japanese voice-overs with English subtitles bring each girl’s distinct personality to life.<br />\nInnovative Multiplayer Modes for 4-Player Battle Royale<br />\nUp to four players can compete online in one of three modes; classic Death Match, Strip Battle to unclothe your opponents, and Understorm, a race to grab the most falling undergarments from the sky.</p>",

Some fight for the authorities, others for the highest bidder, but all of them have one thing in common: They kick ass and know how to look good doing it.\nSENRAN KAGURA SHINOVI VERSUS immediately follows the events of SENRAN KAGURA Burst, revisiting the fierce rivalry between the girls of Hanzō National Academy and their sworn enemies from Hebijo Clandestine Girls’ Academy, the latter of which have now gone underground and formed a mercenary strike team known as the Homura Crimson Squad. In addition to their old adversaries, the Hanzō girls must also face a whole new set of foes: the students of Gessen Girls’ Academy, who seek to punish them for their imperfections as shinobi warriors. Meanwhile, a new class is in session at Hebijo, and these students mean business: they oppose all three of the competing factions and will stop at nothing to be the last shinobi squad standing – even if it means leaving broken bodies and shattered dreams in their wake.\nThe stage is set for a shinobi battle royale. Heroines and renegades battle saints and sinners in a flurry of fists, feet, clothes, tattered remnants of those clothes, and sometimes underclothes. Each school has a story to tell, full of tragedy, heroism, pathos and partial nudity. Choose a school, prepare for battle, and follow the Path of the Shinobi.Key Features:A Little Violent, a Little Sexy, a Ton of Fun\nFight with a team of buxom ninja girls in a 3D brawler containing massive mid-air combos, revealing cut-scenes and special Secret Ninja Art techniques, all while struggling to stay clothed as damage is depicted by the deterioration of each girl’s outfit. Now in HD and silky smooth 60fps on Windows PC.\nMaster over 20 Fighters, each with a Unique Fighting Style and Abilities\nEach of the 20+ shinobi has her own unique weapon, techniques and special moves, while Ninja Arts can be harnessed to change costumes and power up in mid-battle. PC version comes standard with all DLC from the original PlayStation(r)Vita system release.\nStory Narrative told from Four Different Viewpoints\nEach of the four rival shinobi schools takes a turn at the story narrative, providing background on motivations, relationships and hobbies, while the original Japanese voice-overs with English subtitles bring each girl’s distinct personality to life.\nInnovative Multiplayer Modes for 4-Player Battle Royale\nUp to four players can compete online in one of three modes; classic Death Match, Strip Battle to unclothe your opponents, and Understorm, a race to grab the most falling undergarments from the sky."

The game world transforms during the game as a result of player actions.</p>\n<p>Players can use a safe house named &#39;Safe Haven&#39; that is accessed either further into the plot development or by finding mirrors during the game. This safe house features a save room, an upgrade room, and several storage safes.</p>\n<p>Although the ammunition is hard to find in the game, players have access to a wide variety of firearms which include but are not limited to a revolver, shotgun, and a sniper rifle.</p>",

The hospital is filled with dead bodies upon the police arrival. Castellanos has to find out what is going on in the Beacon.\n\nBeing a survival horror, looking for supplies is crucial in The Evil Within. The game teaches the player when should they run away from the enemy or pick up the fight. Terrible monsters are not the only dangers in the game as there are a lot of traps scattered around the level that can be either used by Sebastian or trap him causing a lot of damage. The game world transforms during the game as a result of player actions.\n\nPlayers can use a safe house named 'Safe Haven' that is accessed either further into the plot development or by finding mirrors during the game. This safe house features a save room, an upgrade room, and several storage safes.\n\nAlthough the ammunition is hard to find in the game, players have access to a wide variety of firearms which include but are not limited to a revolver, shotgun, and a sniper rifle."

        "description": "<p>Alien: Isolation is an action-survival horror game played from the first-person perspective for a more intense experience. The game is not a sequel to any of Alien games, but it is directly connected to the original 1979 Alien film, so the gameplay includes historical references, and the game itself transfers the unique atmosphere and the old vision of the future. The action is set 15 years after the film events. Young Amanda Ripley accompanied by Nina Taylor and the android Christopher Samuels reaches a distant space station Sevastopol to investigate the case of her mother Ellen Ripley (the protagonist of the 1979 film) disappearance. On the way to the Nostromo’s (Ellen’s spacecraft) flight recorder, Amanda will face plenty of hardships like hostile androids and Aliens because the Sevastopol station is wholly abandoned. Players have to explore the entire station inhabited with Aliens. Due to the crafting system, players can create the necessary gear to prevent contacts with countless enemies.</p>",

The game is not a sequel to any of Alien games, but it is directly connected to the original 1979 Alien film, so the gameplay includes historical references, and the game itself transfers the unique atmosphere and the old vision of the future. The action is set 15 years after the film events. Young Amanda Ripley accompanied by Nina Taylor and the android Christopher Samuels reaches a distant space station Sevastopol to investigate the case of her mother Ellen Ripley (the protagonist of the 1979 film) disappearance. On the way to the Nostromo’s (Ellen’s spacecraft) flight recorder, Amanda will face plenty of hardships like hostile androids and Aliens because the Sevastopol station is wholly abandoned. Players have to explore the entire station inhabited with Aliens. Due to the crafting system, players can create the necessary gear to prevent contacts with countless enemies."

        "description": "Divekick is the world’s first two-button fighting game. It distills the essence of the fighting game genre into just two buttons with no d-pad directional movement. Divekick’s focused gameplay demonstrates how much depth a single move actually has, and introduces (or reinforces) skills fundamental to the genre: mind games, spacing, timing, and quick reactions.<br/><br/>At Iron Galaxy we love fighting games. To the average fan, most of what makes them fun is hidden behind a never-ending series of input combinations that they have to memorize. That’s why Divekick has just two buttons: Dive (into the air) makes your character jump straight up. Kick causes your character to fly foot first at a downward angle. If you press Kick on the ground, you can jump away from your opponent. Utilizing these moves, the first hit will win the round, and the player that wins five rounds first wins the game. It’s pure adrenaline, awareness, and outsmarting your enemy. It’s a fighting game deconstructed into its purest form. <br/><br/><strong>Key Features</strong><br/><br/><ul><li>14+ Completely unique and original characters, each with their own fighting style and special techniques. <br/></li><li>Includes two extra playable characters: Fencer from Nidhogg and Johnny Gat from Saints Row!<br/></li><li>A story for every character in the game, including an intro, ending, and rival battles. You will be moved to tears! <br/></li><li>Ranked and non-ranked GGPO-powered online multiplayer, the most trusted netcode in fighting games. Includes ranking boards for each character, as well as overall.<br/></li><li>Single player plus Local VS multiplayer for two players, with quick and easy button reconfiguration to accommodate a room full of unique personalities. <br/></li><li>Full Steamworks integration, including Big Picture Mode.</li></ul><br/><strong>Coverage</strong><br/><br/><ul><li>\"How a two-button fighter became the toast of PAX East\" Penny Arcade<br/></li><li>\"Divekick is living the dream of diving and kicking.

        "description_raw": "Divekick is the world’s first two-button fighting game. It distills the essence of the fighting game genre into just two buttons with no d-pad directional movement. Divekick’s focused gameplay demonstrates how much depth a single move actually has, and introduces (or reinforces) skills fundamental to the genre: mind games, spacing, timing, and quick reactions.\nAt Iron Galaxy we love fighting games. To the average fan, most of what makes them fun is hidden behind a never-ending series of input combinations that they have to memorize. That’s why Divekick has just two buttons: Dive (into the air) makes your character jump straight up. Kick causes your character to fly foot first at a downward angle. If you press Kick on the ground, you can jump away from your opponent. Utilizing these moves, the first hit will win the round, and the player that wins five rounds first wins the game. It’s pure adrenaline, awareness, and outsmarting your enemy. It’s a fighting game deconstructed into its purest form.\nKey Features\n14+ Completely unique and original characters, each with their own fighting style and special techniques.\nIncludes two extra playable characters: Fencer from Nidhogg and Johnny Gat from Saints Row!\nA story for every character in the game, including an intro, ending, and rival battles. You will be moved to tears!\nRanked and non-ranked GGPO-powered online multiplayer, the most trusted netcode in fighting games. Includes ranking boards for each character, as well as overall.\nSingle player plus Local VS multiplayer for two players, with quick and easy button reconfiguration to accommodate a room full of unique personalities.\nFull Steamworks integration, including Big Picture Mode.\nCoverage\n\"How a two-button fighter became the toast of PAX East\" Penny Arcade\n\"Divekick is living the dream of diving and kicking. Yes, it is real.\" Kill Screen\n\"Divekick: The best (and only) two-button fighter.\" Shack News\n\"Divekick is the Smartest, Most Absurd Two-Button Fighting Game I've Ever Played\" Kotaku\n\"Divekick and Sportsfriends turns friends and strangers into rivals.\" Venture Beat\nIndieCade 2013\nDivekick has been selected for the IndieCade 2013 Festival which takes place from 10/3 - 10/6 in Los Angeles!"

The primary task is to explore the caves, collecting as many treasures as possible, avoid the traps of enemies. </p>\n<p>A spelunker can whip or jump on opponents to defeat them, can pick up items from the ground that can be thrown at the enemy. You can also set various traps and use a limited supply of bombs and ropes to move through the caves. A notable feature is that the levels are randomly generated and grouped into four complexes &quot;areas&quot;, each of which has a different set of items, enemies, terrain types and special functions.</p>\n<p>The player may also encounter girls who are in difficulty. They can be taken away and attributed to the exit. If you successfully perform this action - health will be replenished. You can unlock the girl as a playable character; the gameplay is identical, except that, playing for her, you meet spelunkers on the way to salvation. Another aspect that can be unlocked - &quot;Tunnel man&quot;, which is present the mattock instead of the whip.</p>",

        "description_raw": "You play as an adventurer known as a spelunker. The primary task is to explore the caves, collecting as many treasures as possible, avoid the traps of enemies. \n\nA spelunker can whip or jump on opponents to defeat them, can pick up items from the ground that can be thrown at the enemy. You can also set various traps and use a limited supply of bombs and ropes to move through the caves. A notable feature is that the levels are randomly generated and grouped into four complexes \"areas\", each of which has a different set of items, enemies, terrain types and special functions.\n\nThe player may also encounter girls who are in difficulty. They can be taken away and attributed to the exit. If you successfully perform this action - health will be replenished. You can unlock the girl as a playable character; the gameplay is identical, except that, playing for her, you meet spelunkers on the way to salvation. Another aspect that can be unlocked - \"Tunnel man\", which is present the mattock instead of the whip."

But the story is not that straightforward as it may seem at first and has couple twists that will keep a player interested until the end credits. Help Styx uncover secrets of his origin and grab all the goodies on the way!</p>\n<p>Embark into the dark world of Akenash tower with unforgettable grumpy commentary from the Styx himself. The world changes dynamically based on player input and developing as well as the story goes. Crawl your way through the tower by orchestrating accidents for your enemies, fighting them in close combat, or just by evading them using one of the Styx’s skills. </p>\n<p>This is the first take on the genre by french Cyanide Studio that fans may know by the Blood Bowl and Pro Cycling Manager series but a promising one: the game was well received among Steam users and console players all over the world.</p>",

But the story is not that straightforward as it may seem at first and has couple twists that will keep a player interested until the end credits. Help Styx uncover secrets of his origin and grab all the goodies on the way!\n\nEmbark into the dark world of Akenash tower with unforgettable grumpy commentary from the Styx himself. The world changes dynamically based on player input and developing as well as the story goes. Crawl your way through the tower by orchestrating accidents for your enemies, fighting them in close combat, or just by evading them using one of the Styx’s skills. \n\nThis is the first take on the genre by french Cyanide Studio that fans may know by the Blood Bowl and Pro Cycling Manager series but a promising one: the game was well received among Steam users and console players all over the world."

As a lone starship pilot lost in a dimensional loop just before a big space battle, with a limited and constantly depleting energy tank, your only hope is to fly as fast as possible over enormous space dreadnoughts, destroying their defenses and the cyan power cubes to get some energy back.<br/><br/>Try to escape the infinite loop of Futuridium: you can count only on your reflexes, your dual lasers, the nimbleness of your starship and... the ability to turn 180° on the spot! Can you beat all the 50 levels, the 5 bosses, unlock all the extra game modes and collect the 150 medals? <br/><br/>Good luck! You’ll need it...",

As a lone starship pilot lost in a dimensional loop just before a big space battle, with a limited and constantly depleting energy tank, your only hope is to fly as fast as possible over enormous space dreadnoughts, destroying their defenses and the cyan power cubes to get some energy back.\nTry to escape the infinite loop of Futuridium: you can count only on your reflexes, your dual lasers, the nimbleness of your starship and... the ability to turn 180° on the spot! Can you beat all the 50 levels, the 5 bosses, unlock all the extra game modes and collect the 150 medals?\nGood luck! You’ll need it..."

        "description": "<p>Sherlock Holmes: Crimes and Punishments is an adventure whodunnit by Frogware. The studio specializes on Sherlock Holmes games. &#39;Crimes and Punishments&#39; is six out of seven games in the series.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The player takes a role of Sherlock Holmes — famous detective. The game consists of 6 non-related cases.<br />\nThe first accentuation in levels is made in investigating the crime scene and searching for clues. After the examinations section comes the deduction one — the player must interconnect the evidence and find out who the culprit is. The burden of punishment is also on the playing one, thus the game title. </p>\n<h3>Story</h3>\n<p>Three out of the six cases — The Fate of Black Peter, The Riddle on the Rails and The Abbey Grange Affair are reminiscent of the original Conan Doyle stories. Thus, the narrative flow and plot twists are adapted from the original whodunnit as well. </p>\n<h3>Features</h3>\n<p>One of the key features of the game is the possibility to guess the culprit wrong ergo making the false accusation. This, in turn, would affect the outcome of further cases. However, with the cases not being firmly tied down together, the impact of player&#39;s mistakes is insignificant. The loading screen as it appears rarely provides one with not only the loading bar but also the evidence to inspect and clues to examine thus using the loading time fully.</p>",

        "description_raw": "Sherlock Holmes: Crimes and Punishments is an adventure whodunnit by Frogware. The studio specializes on Sherlock Holmes games. 'Crimes and Punishments' is six out of seven games in the series.\n\n###Gameplay\nThe player takes a role of Sherlock Holmes — famous detective. The game consists of 6 non-related cases.\nThe first accentuation in levels is made in investigating the crime scene and searching for clues. After the examinations section comes the deduction one — the player must interconnect the evidence and find out who the culprit is. The burden of punishment is also on the playing one, thus the game title. \n\n###Story\nThree out of the six cases — The Fate of Black Peter, The Riddle on the Rails and The Abbey Grange Affair are reminiscent of the original Conan Doyle stories. Thus, the narrative flow and plot twists are adapted from the original whodunnit as well. \n\n###Features\nOne of the key features of the game is the possibility to guess the culprit wrong ergo making the false accusation. This, in turn, would affect the outcome of further cases. However, with the cases not being firmly tied down together, the impact of player's mistakes is insignificant. The loading screen as it appears rarely provides one with not only the loading bar but also the evidence to inspect and clues to examine thus using the loading time fully."

You can then stab those Furies into the world map for new effects in nearby dungeons like EXP boosts or enemy changes - be careful though, because not all effects are good!</li></ul><br/><br/>The following DLC packs are included with download of the main game:<br/><ul><li><strong>Fairy Fencer F: Beginner's Pack</strong>, which includes the following packs: <strong>Beginner's Synthesis Kit</strong>, <strong>Emergency Pack</strong>, and <strong>Assortment of Rare Materials</strong>.<br/></li><li><strong>Fairy Fencer F: Secrets of Shukesoo's Tower Pack</strong>, which includes <strong>Secrets of Shukesoo's Tower 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8.</strong>*<br/><br/>*Upon activation, this DLC cannot be disabled.

The world of Fencers and fairies gets updated with a 1080p graphic overhaul! Fairizing never looked so good.\nReally Reluctant Hero With a hero more interested in his next meal and a fairy partner who will have none of it, this saving-the-world narrative is injected with oodles of madcap humor!\nHigh Tension! Increase the Tension gauge in battle by dealing and receiving damage. The higher it is, the more damage you’ll dish. Once it’s high enough, you’ll be able to Fairize – combining with your fairy to create a super-powerful form!\nFairy’s Fate Find fairies to join you in your quest – only they can grant you special abilities, and by leveling them up you’ll also increase your effect radius in…\nWorld-Shaping! Pull Furies from the Goddess and Vile God and place your fairies in them. You can then stab those Furies into the world map for new effects in nearby dungeons like EXP boosts or enemy changes - be careful though, because not all effects are good!\nThe following DLC packs are included with download of the main game:\nFairy Fencer F: Beginner's Pack, which includes the following packs: Beginner's Synthesis Kit, Emergency Pack, and Assortment of Rare Materials.\nFairy Fencer F: Secrets of Shukesoo's Tower Pack, which includes Secrets of Shukesoo's Tower 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8.*\n*Upon activation, this DLC cannot be disabled.

You and your classmates at the elite Hope's Peak Academy have been brought to this island by your super-cute teacher for a “lovey-dovey, heart-throbbing school trip.” Everyone seems to be having fun in the sun...until Monokuma returns to restart his murderous game! Trapped on this island of mutual killing, your only hope of escape rests in solving the island’s mysteries. But be warned—sometimes the truth can be its own despair...\nKey Features\nDeadly Island Vibes: Murder is the only means of escape when you’re trapped on this island paradise. As your fellow classmates start dropping like coconuts, you’ll need to delve into each murderous incident, forage for clues, and interview your classmates to reveal the opportunity, motive, and means behind each killer case!\nTribal Council: You’ll go head-to-head in all new minigames with the other students during the Class Trial, shooting down their false truths and using your evidence to uncover what really happened. But watch out! If a student is unconvinced, they'll challenge you to a one-on-one Rebuttal Showdown and force you to defend your argument!\nSurvival of the Keenest: Match up your evidence with your fellow classmates’ arguments and determine who’s really telling the truth. Once you’ve got a suspect in your sights, turn up that tropical heat in a variety of timing and reflex-based game systems to reveal the ultimate truth and escape with your life!\nSteam Features: Supports Steam Achievements and Steam Cloud with plans to add Steam Trading Cards"

The primary focus of all three games is competing with the other players, teleporting and fighting numerous enemies — the game features some characteristics of bullet hell genre.<br />\nThe story centers around Apex Predator — the protagonist of the game. While being set in a sci-fi setting the game tells a story of her modified body, which allows her and her ship to travel at supersonic speeds and uncover the mysteries of a world she ended up blending in.<br />\nThe gameplay utilizes typical characteristics for the genre: much shooting, teleporting and reaching the higher overall score over the levels. The title also features dual-format: not only it allows to mirror the screen and make the levels more challenging but also it creates a room for bosses to be more robust.</p>",

The primary focus of all three games is competing with the other players, teleporting and fighting numerous enemies — the game features some characteristics of bullet hell genre.\nThe story centers around Apex Predator — the protagonist of the game. While being set in a sci-fi setting the game tells a story of her modified body, which allows her and her ship to travel at supersonic speeds and uncover the mysteries of a world she ended up blending in.\nThe gameplay utilizes typical characteristics for the genre: much shooting, teleporting and reaching the higher overall score over the levels. The title also features dual-format: not only it allows to mirror the screen and make the levels more challenging but also it creates a room for bosses to be more robust."

It is a spin-off/prequel hybrid to inFAMOUS Second Son, the third installment in the series.</p>\n<p>7 years ago an explosion in a fictional Empire City caused a plague outbreak. During that time people with superpowers known as Conduits start to appear. Most of the conduits died fighting the outbreak. After these events, the U.S. government established the Department of Unified Protection. The Conduits are considered bio-terrorists and held prisoner. The game tells the story of Abigail Walker who possesses the power of neon, how she was captured by the D.U.P. and imprisoned in Curdun Cay. The story is set 3 years before the events of InFAMOUS Second Son.</p>\n<p>The game focuses on the neon power that was one of the powers present in InFAMOUS Second Son. Neon power is used for distant precise powerful attacks. The Neon Beam deals a lot of damage yet it has a low fire rate. In addition to normal Neon Beam, it is possible to use Stasis Bubbles that freeze the enemies. A more powerful charged Phosphor Beam is also present. Players can travel at high speeds using the Light Speed.</p>",

It is a spin-off/prequel hybrid to inFAMOUS Second Son, the third installment in the series.\r\n\r\n7 years ago an explosion in a fictional Empire City caused a plague outbreak. During that time people with superpowers known as Conduits start to appear. Most of the conduits died fighting the outbreak. After these events, the U.S. government established the Department of Unified Protection. The Conduits are considered bio-terrorists and held prisoner. The game tells the story of Abigail Walker who possesses the power of neon, how she was captured by the D.U.P. and imprisoned in Curdun Cay. The story is set 3 years before the events of InFAMOUS Second Son.\r\n\r\nThe game focuses on the neon power that was one of the powers present in InFAMOUS Second Son. Neon power is used for distant precise powerful attacks. The Neon Beam deals a lot of damage yet it has a low fire rate. In addition to normal Neon Beam, it is possible to use Stasis Bubbles that freeze the enemies. A more powerful charged Phosphor Beam is also present. Players can travel at high speeds using the Light Speed."

        "description": "<p>Metro 2033 Redux is a rebuilt extended version of the original post-apocalyptic first-person action shooter Metro 2033. The game saved its pace and atmosphere of the gone world and except numerous technical issues, added several survival elements to the gameplay. The main plot is based on Dmitry Glukhovsky’s book Metro 2033. According to the storyline, the Earth was devastated by the nuclear war, and only a few people were able to survive hiding in the underground warehouses. Players assume the role of Artem, 20-year-old inhabitant of Moscow underground, whose aim is to learn more about the anomalies called the Dark Ones. With the remastered version of the game developers added some visual effects: new high-quality textures, shaders, dynamic light and weather (on the surface) systems. The gameplay was also extended with various realistic features like bots’ intelligence and collectible resources count. Within the game, players face two new difficulty settings (Survival and Spartan), which are expected to improve the gaming experience.</p>",

The game saved its pace and atmosphere of the gone world and except numerous technical issues, added several survival elements to the gameplay. The main plot is based on Dmitry Glukhovsky’s book Metro 2033. According to the storyline, the Earth was devastated by the nuclear war, and only a few people were able to survive hiding in the underground warehouses. Players assume the role of Artem, 20-year-old inhabitant of Moscow underground, whose aim is to learn more about the anomalies called the Dark Ones. With the remastered version of the game developers added some visual effects: new high-quality textures, shaders, dynamic light and weather (on the surface) systems. The gameplay was also extended with various realistic features like bots’ intelligence and collectible resources count. Within the game, players face two new difficulty settings (Survival and Spartan), which are expected to improve the gaming experience."

Both games are based on the world of Dmitry Glukhovsky&#39;s novel Metro 2033 - in post-apocalyptic Moscow, in the tunnels of subway lines groups of very different people survive. And not only people. There are mutated people there, and mutated animals. They are distinguished by unusual abilities, but even more - behaviour strategies. In the struggle for the remnants of resources, all these beings spend their gloomy days.<br />\nAll characters use unusual and unexpected means for life and war. Something is created from the remnants of a past, normal life, something has already appeared in a new, changed world.<br />\nLocations are struck by an unusual synthesis of the ruins of a known world and traces of a catastrophe.<br />\nFrom the previous game Metro: Last Light differs, according to general opinion, by careful work on the remarks and shortcomings of the previous game. The set of weapons is significantly expanded, the technologies of Metro 2033 have become more developed.<br />\nThe game has two fundamentally different endings and five additions.</p>",

Both games are based on the world of Dmitry Glukhovsky's novel Metro 2033 - in post-apocalyptic Moscow, in the tunnels of subway lines groups of very different people survive. And not only people. There are mutated people there, and mutated animals. They are distinguished by unusual abilities, but even more - behaviour strategies. In the struggle for the remnants of resources, all these beings spend their gloomy days.\nAll characters use unusual and unexpected means for life and war. Something is created from the remnants of a past, normal life, something has already appeared in a new, changed world.\nLocations are struck by an unusual synthesis of the ruins of a known world and traces of a catastrophe.\nFrom the previous game Metro: Last Light differs, according to general opinion, by careful work on the remarks and shortcomings of the previous game. The set of weapons is significantly expanded, the technologies of Metro 2033 have become more developed.\nThe game has two fundamentally different endings and five additions."

        "description": "<p>The Golf Club is HB Studios’ next generation golf simulation. Stunning visual presentation and outstanding gameplay are to be expected but what really takes The Golf Club into the next generation is the procedural generation of courses and depth of social interaction. The Course Creator can generate a brand new course in seconds which can be shared and played immediately online with friends and other gamers across the world. There are also full editing capabilities for courses, Tournaments and Tours. Challenge your friends on a new or existing course in real time or try to beat their best recorded round. Add to this a myriad of stat tracking and personal bests of friends and rivals to beat, notifications, challenges and social media integration and you truly have a golf club worth joining.INTUITIVE CONTROL SYSTEMWe’ve created and fine tuned a swing mechanic that is more about feeling and fluidity above the users’ accuracy of hitting a marker on a power bar. Whilst anyone will be able to pick the controller up and play comfortably, the best players on the global leaderboards will be those with the best feel for the different golf shots and who are able to take into account ball lie, weather and terrain conditions.INSTANTANEOUS GAMEPLAY<br />\nNo loading times between holes means you are straight back on the Tee after sinking your putt on the previous green. Also, minimal loading times into a new course make for a refreshing change to your typical console game.UNLIMITED COURSES<br />\nNo more getting bored of the courses given to you by the developer. With four clicks you can generate a unique course never seen before that’s ready to play.GENERATE COURSES<br />\nWith four clicks of a button from the main menu the game will generate for you a never been played before course. The variation is infinite!<br />\nIf you want to tailor the courses a little more there are high-level options available to you. Examples of these are the number of holes, par distribution, fairway width, number of bunkers, green size, green slope and rough coverage.EDIT AND CREATE YOUR OWN COURSES<br />\nThe editor gives you the ability of create from scratch or mould anything on the course. You can alter the terrain, move tees, move greens, move holes, delete holes, add holes, bunkers, rivers, ponds, trees, foliage, buildings, animals and other objects.LARGE SELECTION OF PRE-DESIGNED COURSES SHIPPING WITH THE GAME<br />\nCourses for all skill levels and utilizing the best of HB’s creative talents will ship with the game. They can be played individually but will also make up the tournament itinerary for the pre-designed Tour that also comes with the game.LOCAL MULTIPLAYER<br />\nUp to four players can play locally. Differentiate yourselves with different character models and clothing and choose between stroke play, match play or fourball.ONLINE SHARING AND PLAY<br />\nPlay others creations - work your way through the huge database of user created courses, each rated by other users to help make the decision easy to make.<br />\nShare your courses with the World – when you’re happy with your creations you can publish them for the rest of the world to play.<br />\nPlay against others live or from the past - each round you play on every course is saved Online. Choose from Friends Rounds, Record Rounds or Rivals Rounds (others players close to your ability) to compete against. Their ghost balls and scores will be visible throughout your round giving you the feeling of competition without losing the instantaneous game play. Ghost and live balls can be hidden if so desired either selectively or en masse.<br />\nWatch others play the courses you’re on live – through our ball trace system you can see other users from around the world on the course that you are playing live, even if they’re on different holes.</p>",

        "description_raw": "The Golf Club is HB Studios’ next generation golf simulation. Stunning visual presentation and outstanding gameplay are to be expected but what really takes The Golf Club into the next generation is the procedural generation of courses and depth of social interaction. The Course Creator can generate a brand new course in seconds which can be shared and played immediately online with friends and other gamers across the world. There are also full editing capabilities for courses, Tournaments and Tours. Challenge your friends on a new or existing course in real time or try to beat their best recorded round. Add to this a myriad of stat tracking and personal bests of friends and rivals to beat, notifications, challenges and social media integration and you truly have a golf club worth joining.INTUITIVE CONTROL SYSTEMWe’ve created and fine tuned a swing mechanic that is more about feeling and fluidity above the users’ accuracy of hitting a marker on a power bar. Whilst anyone will be able to pick the controller up and play comfortably, the best players on the global leaderboards will be those with the best feel for the different golf shots and who are able to take into account ball lie, weather and terrain conditions.INSTANTANEOUS GAMEPLAY\nNo loading times between holes means you are straight back on the Tee after sinking your putt on the previous green. Also, minimal loading times into a new course make for a refreshing change to your typical console game.UNLIMITED COURSES\nNo more getting bored of the courses given to you by the developer. With four clicks you can generate a unique course never seen before that’s ready to play.GENERATE COURSES\nWith four clicks of a button from the main menu the game will generate for you a never been played before course. The variation is infinite!\nIf you want to tailor the courses a little more there are high-level options available to you. Examples of these are the number of holes, par distribution, fairway width, number of bunkers, green size, green slope and rough coverage.EDIT AND CREATE YOUR OWN COURSES\nThe editor gives you the ability of create from scratch or mould anything on the course. You can alter the terrain, move tees, move greens, move holes, delete holes, add holes, bunkers, rivers, ponds, trees, foliage, buildings, animals and other objects.LARGE SELECTION OF PRE-DESIGNED COURSES SHIPPING WITH THE GAME\nCourses for all skill levels and utilizing the best of HB’s creative talents will ship with the game. They can be played individually but will also make up the tournament itinerary for the pre-designed Tour that also comes with the game.LOCAL MULTIPLAYER\nUp to four players can play locally. Differentiate yourselves with different character models and clothing and choose between stroke play, match play or fourball.ONLINE SHARING AND PLAY\nPlay others creations - work your way through the huge database of user created courses, each rated by other users to help make the decision easy to make.\nShare your courses with the World – when you’re happy with your creations you can publish them for the rest of the world to play.\nPlay against others live or from the past - each round you play on every course is saved Online. Choose from Friends Rounds, Record Rounds or Rivals Rounds (others players close to your ability) to compete against. Their ghost balls and scores will be visible throughout your round giving you the feeling of competition without losing the instantaneous game play. Ghost and live balls can be hidden if so desired either selectively or en masse.\nWatch others play the courses you’re on live – through our ball trace system you can see other users from around the world on the course that you are playing live, even if they’re on different holes."

Over the course of the game, the player will be able to collect the masks that provide buffs and abilities. Fluid and tight combat includes various melee and ranged weapons, that can be used as intended or just thrown at the enemy. Once Jacket, dubbed so for his distinct letterman jacket by fans, arrives at the mission, players will have to clear out every floor from the enemies, using rooms and doors for cover or ambushes. As the story moves on, Jackets mental health will visibly deteriorate, and he will be shown to suffer from hallucinations, which is in tone with acid 80’s theme.</p>",

Over the course of the game, the player will be able to collect the masks that provide buffs and abilities. Fluid and tight combat includes various melee and ranged weapons, that can be used as intended or just thrown at the enemy. Once Jacket, dubbed so for his distinct letterman jacket by fans, arrives at the mission, players will have to clear out every floor from the enemies, using rooms and doors for cover or ambushes. As the story moves on, Jackets mental health will visibly deteriorate, and he will be shown to suffer from hallucinations, which is in tone with acid 80’s theme."

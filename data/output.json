And out of all her works, Monroe is permitted to keep only one favorite, a swan with a missing neck. And one night he wakes up to see the swan escape, and after the short chase players will find themselves in a painted unfinished world, finding the missing swan.<br />\nOver the course of the game, players will use a magic silver brush to spread the black paint over the blank and completely white environment, to locate a way to progress and solutions to puzzles, while the narrator tells a story of a Lonely King. Most of the environments and the painting tool are used to show players, that Unfinished Swan is more of a narrative experience, where puzzles are not stopping your progress entirely, but act as an obstacle.

To the average fan, most of what makes them fun is hidden behind a never-ending series of input combinations that they have to memorize. That’s why Divekick has just two buttons: Dive (into the air) makes your character jump straight up. Kick causes your character to fly foot first at a downward angle. If you press Kick on the ground, you can jump away from your opponent. Utilizing these moves, the first hit will win the round, and the player that wins five rounds first wins the game. It’s pure adrenaline, awareness, and outsmarting your enemy. It’s a fighting game deconstructed into its purest form. <br/><br/><strong>Key Features</strong><br/><br/><ul><li>14+ Completely unique and original characters, each with their own fighting style and special techniques. <br/></li><li>Includes two extra playable characters: Fencer from Nidhogg and Johnny Gat from Saints Row!<br/></li><li>A story for every character in the game, including an intro, ending, and rival battles.

The game consists of 6 non-related cases.<br />\nThe first accentuation in levels is made in investigating the crime scene and searching for clues. After the examinations section comes the deduction one — the player must interconnect the evidence and find out who the culprit is. The burden of punishment is also on the playing one, thus the game title. </p>\n<h3>Story</h3>\n<p>Three out of the six cases — The Fate of Black Peter, The Riddle on the Rails and The Abbey Grange Affair are reminiscent of the original Conan Doyle stories. Thus, the narrative flow and plot twists are adapted from the original whodunnit as well. </p>\n<h3>Features</h3>\n<p>One of the key features of the game is the possibility to guess the culprit wrong ergo making the false accusation. This, in turn, would affect the outcome of further cases. However, with the cases not being firmly tied down together, the impact of player&#39;s mistakes is insignificant.
